yarn install

# 1. Start shadow-cljs frontend compilation server:
npx shadow-cljs watch main
# 2. Start the backend server:
#    (Note: for proper development you will want to start it in a nREPL-based
#     REPL, see the detailed instructions for "The API Server" below.)
clj -A:dev
user=> (require 'development)
user=> (in-ns 'development)
development=> (start)
# after modifications of the backend code run: `(restart)`
